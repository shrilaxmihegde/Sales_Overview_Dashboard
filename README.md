### Overview of the project :
Design a dynamic Power BI dashboard that tracks key metrics—sales, Profit, and Quantity—across four regions: Central, East, South, and West. The dashboard should allow users to filter by year and dynamically switch between the three metrics (Sales, Profit, and Quantity). Additionally, it should include a comparison with the previous year's (PY) sales for the selected year.


#### Sales by State:

##### Bubble Map: Display a bubble map to visualize sales distribution across different states. The size of each bubble should correspond to the sales volume, allowing users to identify states with high or low sales quickly.
##### Bar Chart: Place a bar chart alongside the bubble map to provide a detailed breakdown of sales by state. This chart should allow for easy comparison between states, with bars sorted either in ascending or descending order of sales.
